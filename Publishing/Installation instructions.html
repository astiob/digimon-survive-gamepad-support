<li>In your Steam Library, right-click Digimon Survive (or click the gear button for Digimon Survive) and select Manage → Browse Local Files or Properties → Local Files → Browse. This will open the game’s file folder.</li>
<li>Download the mod’s combined installation package and copy/extract all the files from “Files to extract” into the game’s folder, so that the folder looks like this:<br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1001511860547362866/1004409905509322882/2022-08-03_182607.png"><br>If you already have BepInEx from another mod, you can instead download the plugin-only package and just copy/extract <samp>GamepadSupportPlugin.dll</samp> into the <samp>BepInEx\plugins</samp> folder.</li>
<li>If you’re using Linux/Proton (including Steam Deck), open Digimon Survive in your Steam Library, press the gear button, select Properties, and put this in Launch Options:
<pre><kbd>WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%</kbd></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. The mod will be active whenever you launch the game.</p>
