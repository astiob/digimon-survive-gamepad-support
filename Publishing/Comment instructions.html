<p>What kind of controller have <em>you</em> gotten to work using this mod?</p>
<hr>
<p>The plugin records your gamepad configuration in the file <samp>BepInEx\LogOutput.log</samp> in the game’s folder. Show the contents of this file if you’re having problems.</p>
<p>If you’re sharing a success story about the Steam Deck or a controller type not previously mentioned, I’d also be curious to see that file’s contents, but it’s not mandatory.</p>
